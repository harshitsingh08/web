    <h1>Six Best Back Exercises For Strength And Muscle Gain</h1>
</div>

<div id="one">
    <h2>1.Deadlift</h2>
    <h3> Stand in front of a loaded barbell with your feet shoulder-width apart, hips back, and back flat. The knees should be bent slightly to allow you to grip the bar tightly slightly wider than shoulder-width. Keeping your back flat and chest up, tighten the back muscles, and straighten the arms as you load the pull.   </h3>
    <h3> With everything locked, aggressively push your legs into the floor as you simultaneously pull your chest and shoulders upwards, lifting the bar to the hip.

    </h3>
</div>

<div id="two">
    <h2>2.Pull-Up</h2>
    <h3>Assume an overhead grip on the bar, slightly wider than shoulder-width. With the arms relaxed and shoulders elevated up to the ears, contract the core and upper back as you initiate the pull-up.</h3>
    <h3>Aim to pull your chin to or above the bar level, driving your shoulders away from the ears. 

    </h3>
</div>
<div id="three">
    <h2>3.Bent-Over Row</h2>
    <h3>Set up as you would for your deadlift by standing feet shoulder-width apart in front of a loaded barbell. Hinge at the hips until your torso is about parallel to the floor.</h3>
    <h3>Grab the barbell with a grip that’s a bit wider than your typical deadlift grip. Lean back, so your weight is on your heels, and row the barbell, leading the pull with your elbow until it touches around your belly button. 

    </h3>
</div>
<div id="four">
    <h2>4.Chest Supported Row</h2>
    <h3>Set a workout bench to a 45-degree incline and lay face down on it so your chest and stomach are supported.</h3>
    <h3>Grab a dumbbell in each hand and then row them to your sides until your elbows pass your torso. Slowly lower the weight under control.

    </h3>
</div>
<div id="five">
    <h2>5.Single-Arm Row</h2>
    <h3>Stand next to a bench so that it’s parallel to you. Place the same-side hand and knee on it, and firmly plant your other foot onto the floor. Reach down with your free hand and grab a dumbbell.</h3>
    <h3>Keep your back flat and your head in a neutral position. Row the dumbbell to your side until your elbow passes your torso. Complete all of your reps on one side and then switch.

    </h3>
</div>
<div id="six">
    <h2>6.Inverted Row</h2>
    <h3>Place a bar in a rack so that it is supported and stable. When you lay down underneath it, your hands should just reach the bar. Adjust the height as needed. </h3>
    <h3>Grasp the bar firmly and set the body in a rigid plank position. Pull your chest to the bar, making sure to keep the elbows from flaring out.

    </h3>

    <h1>Four Best Biceps Exercises For Greater Growth</h1>
</div>
<div id="one_b">
    <h2>1.Barbell Curl</h2>
    <h3>Grab a barbell with an underhand grip, slightly wider than the shoulders. With the chest up and shoulder blades pulled tightly together, expose the front of your biceps by pulling the shoulders back into the socket. The elbows should reside under the shoulder joint, or slightly in front by the ribs. </h3>
    <h3>Curl the barbell up using the biceps, making sure not to let the torso lean forward, shoulder collapse forward, or the elbows slide backward to the side of the body (they should stay slightly in front of the shoulders).</h3>
</div>
<div id="two_b">
    <h2>2.Chin-Up</h2>
    <h3>Hang from a bar with palms facing you and the hands about shoulder-width apart, or slightly wider.</h3>
    <h3>From a dead hang, squeeze your shoulder blades together and pull your body up, making sure not to let the body fold inwards (so many people do this) until your chin is at or above the bar.

    </h3>
</div>
<div id="three_b">
    <h2>3.EZ-Bar Preacher Curl</h2>
    <h3>Sit down on a preacher bench and rest the back of your triceps on the pad. Set your body in the same position as the standard barbell biceps curl (chest up, shoulders back, and elbows slightly forward). Grasp the EZ-bar handle on the inner angled pieces. This will place your hands slightly narrower than shoulder-width and on a semi-supinated angle.</h3>
    <h3>With the body locked in place, curl the bar upwards as you flex the biceps, briefly pausing at the top of the curl to flex the biceps. Lower the weight under control.

    </h3>
</div>
<div id="four_b">
    <h2>4.Hammer Curl</h2>
    <h3>Hold a dumbbell in each hand while standing. Turn your wrists so that they’re facing each other. </h3>
    <h3>Keep your arms tucked in at your sides and flex your elbows to curl the dumbbells up towards your shoulders. Lower them back down with control.

    </h3>
