    <h1> 6 BEST CORE EXERCISES AND HOW TO DO THEM </h1> 
</div>
<div id="one">
    <h2>1.HOLLOWMAN</h2>
    <h3>Lie on your back with legs at 45-degrees, arms by the side and chin tucked. Your back should be flat on the ground. Tuck hip bones and rib cage together and squeeze stomach, quads and glutes.</h3>
    <h3>Breathe deeply to engage the diaphragm. Tuck your chin. Pull shoulders down and away from your ears.</h3>
</div>
<div id="two">
    <h2>2.HIGH PLANK</h2>
    <h3>Place hands on the floor shoulder-width apart, same with legs. Keep neck neutral, slightly looking forward but at the floor. Make sure you keep your butt tucked in, your back flat and your stomach tight to use your core muscles and avoid lower back pain. </h3>
    <h3>Make sure you squeeze your legs and glutes, as they are an extension of your core. Rounding your shoulders can feel nice and helps support the lower back.</h3>
</div>
<div id="three">
    <h2>3.GLUTE BRIDGE</h2>
    <h3>Lie on your back with feet shoulder-width apart and flat on the floor. Keep your hands on the ground. Raise your hips slowly by squeezing your glutes (butt) while keeping your core (mid-section) tight.</h3>
    <h3>Return to starting position</h3>
</div>
<div id="four">
    <h2>4. V-UPS</h2>
    <h3>Lie on your back with your arms above your head </h3>
    <h3>Legs remain straight with feet together or as close together as possible</h3>
    <h3>At the same time, role shoulders off the ground to “crunch” your stomach, and lift your legs off the ground. Try to keep them mostly straight.</h3>
    <h3>Form a “V” with your body where your hands and legs come together to touch </h3>
    <h3>Return back to starting position slowly</h3>

</div>
<div id="five">
    <h2>5. LEG RAISES </h2>
    <h3>Lying flat on your back, start with your legs in the air (90-degrees) and feet together </h3>
    <h3>Arms stay flat by your sides</h3>
    <h3>Keep chin tucked in </h3>
    <h3>Core engaged and strong </h3>
    <h3>Keep back flat on the ground. You should not be able to place a hand under your back</h3>
    <h3>Slowly lower your legs to just above the floor </h3>
    <h3>Return to starting position </h3>
</div>
<div id="six">
    <h2>6.BICYCLE CRUNCHES</h2>
    <h3>Lie on your back and lift legs off the ground so there is a 90-degree angle at the hip and knee joints</h3>
    <h3>Place hands behind your head but keep elbows out wide </h3>
    <h3>Lift head and upper back off the ground and engage core muscles </h3>
    <h3>Use obliques to perform a “crunch” motion while bringing right elbow and left knee close together at the same time. While making this motion, straighten the right leg. </h3>
    <h3>Return to starting position</h3>
    <h3>Repeat on the opposite side</h3>
