    content: "Shoulder training has several benefits beyond the aesthetic; it enhances posture and strengthens the muscles surrounding the shoulder joint, creating more stability and an overall sturdier body structure. The shoulder joint is one of the most delicate joints. The shoulder joint allows a greater range of movement (think about doing arm circles). When the muscles surrounding the shoulder joint are weak, this movement can become altered, creating instability and often leading to injury. Keeping the shoulders free from injury means training the rotator cuff (muscles that stabilize the shoulder) as well as the deltoid muscle (the muscle you can see that surrounds the shoulder). ";

Close to the spine and deep inside the abdomen is the inner core, which is comprised of the diaphragm, pelvic floor, multifidi, deep cervical flexors, and transverse abdominus. These strange-sounding muscles engage first during movement or breathing to protect the spine.The outer core muscles are also responsible for stabilizing and protecting the spine, but they also have more defined movement functions. The anterior muscles (abdominals) are the most well-known members of the outer-core assembly. The lats, spinal erectors, glute complex, quadratus lumborum, and hip flexors are also outer-core muscles.";
