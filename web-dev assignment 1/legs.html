        </div>
        <div id="one">
            <h2>1.Squats </h2>
            <h3>Stance will vary slightly from person to person, Tamir explains, but your feet should be between hip- and shoulder-width distance apart, with your toes slightly turned out (between 5 and 15 degrees). Your spine should be neutral, shoulders back, chest open. Make sure you keep your heels down and keep them planted throughout the move. You can clasp hands in front of chest for balance. </h3>
            <h3>Initiate the movement by sending the hips back as if you’re sitting back into an invisible chair. Bend knees to lower down as far as possible with chest lifted in a controlled movement. Keep lower back neutral. Press through heels to stand back up to starting position. Repeat.  </h3>
        <h3>Aim to get thighs at least parallel to the floor. To do this, squat down so your thighs are even with your knees. If mobility allows, lower further. As you come back up, make sure hips are set right under your ribs— you don’t want your hips to pull too far back, Tamir says.</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="two">
            <h2>2.Walking Lunges </h2>
            <h3>Rest your hands on your hips, then take one large step forward with your right leg, keeping your torso upright. Bend the knees and lower your body into the lunge position, stopping when your legs are forming 90-degree angles.  </h3>
            <h3>Press through the right foot and step forward again so that you land in the same position with your left side, as if you are "walking." (Pro tip: Amp up the effort by adding dumbbells into the mix.)  </h3>
        </div>
       
        </div>
        <div id="three">
            <h2>3.Sumo Deadlift</h2>
            <h3>Holding two kettlebells or dumbbells, stand with feet slightly wider than hip-width apart, toes pointed out. </h3>
            <h3>Position weights in front of thighs, palms facing in. Keeping knees slightly bent, press hips back as you hinge at the waist and lower the weights toward the floor. Squeeze glutes to return to standing. That's one rep.  </h3>
        </div>
        <div id="four">
            <h2>4.Squat with Heel Raise</h2>
            <h3>Stand with heels wider then shoulder-distance apart, toes turned out slightly. Bend knees, reach hips back, and lower down into a squat. </h3>
            <h3>Drop arms down in between legs. Then, drive in into heels to stand up, circling arms out to the sides. At the top, lift arms straight up overhead and press up onto toes. That's one rep.  </h3>
        </div>
        <div id="five">
            <h2>5.Isometric Squat </h2>
            <h3> Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, hands clasped in front of chest. Push hips back and bend knees to sink hips until thighs are nearly parallel to the ground. </h3>
            <h3> Hold for up to 30 seconds. That's one rep. </h3>
        </div>
        <div id="six">
            <h2>6.Stability Ball Hamstring Curl </h2>
            <h3>Start lying on back with arms at sides and legs extended at 45-degree angle, feet resting on stability ball. Press into upper back and arms to lift hips off ground.  </h3>
            <h3>Then, bend knees and engage hamstrings to pull heels toward butt. Re-extend legs. That's one rep.  </h3>
        </div>

            <h1>Four Most Effective Triceps Exercises</h1>
        </div>
        <div id="one_b">
            <h2>1.Diamond Push-Ups </h2>
            <h3>Begin the move by positioning the hands on the mat directly under the chest with the fingers spread and the thumbs and forefingers touching, making a diamond shape. </h3>
            <h3>Straighten the legs into a plank position, or keep the knees on the floor for an easier version.  </h3>
        <h3>Make sure the back is flat and the abs are engaged as you bend the elbows, lowering until your chin or chest touches the mat. If you can't go that low, go as low as you can—then work to build enough strength to lower all the way down over time.</h3>
    <h3>At the bottom of the movement, your elbows should stay in close to your sides. </h3>
    <h3>Press back to start, keeping the torso rigid, and repeat for 1 to 3 sets of 8 to 16 reps. </h3>

    </div>
        <div id="two_b">
            <h2>2.Kickbacks </h2>
            <h3>Prop the right foot on a step or platform, resting the right forearm on the thigh to support the back, or allowing the arm to drop directly below the shoulder. </h3>
            <h3>Hold a weight in the left hand and pull the elbow up to torso level.  </h3>
            <h3>Keeping the elbow in that position, extend the arm behind you, focusing on contracting the triceps muscle. </h3>
            <h3>Lower the forearm down to about 90 degrees and repeat for 1 to 3 sets of 8 to 16 reps. </h3>
            <h3>Focus on keeping the upper arm stationary against the body throughout the exercise. </h3>

        </div>
        <div id="three_b">
            <h2>3.Dips </h2>
            <h3>Sit on a chair or bench with your hands just outside of the hips and the knees bent or the legs extended straight out (harder). </h3>
            <h3>Lift up onto the hands and, keeping the hips very close to the chair or bench, bend the elbows, lowering down until they're at about 90 degrees.  </h3>
            <h3>Keep the elbows pointing behind you, the shoulders down and the abs engaged. </h3>
            <h3>Push back to start and repeat for 1 to 3 sets of 8 to 16 reps. </h3>
            <h3>Avoid this exercise if you feel any pain in the shoulders. </h3>

            <h2>4.Overhead Triceps Extensions </h2>
            <h3>Sit on a chair, bench, or ball, or stand; keep back straight. Hold a weight in both hands, extending it up overhead. </h3>
            <h3>Keep your biceps close to your ears and elbows pointing forward as you lower the weight behind your head until the elbows are at about 90-degree angles.  </h3>
            <h3>Straighten the arms, contracting the triceps, and then repeat for 1 to 3 sets of 8 to 16 reps. </h3>
            <h3>Keep the abs engaged throughout the exercise and avoid arching the back. </h3>
