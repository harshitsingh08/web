    <h2>1.Barbell Overhead Press</h2> </div>

    <div class="kid-2">
    <h3> With the bar right in front of you, place your hands just outside your shoulders. Your elbows and forearms should be in a vertical position, stacked upon each other. If your elbows are pointing out or in, your grip is either too narrow or too wide. Please adjust accordingly.</h3>
    <h3> Put the bar on the heel of your palm because this is where you’ll generate the most force from.  Press overhead until lockout and slowly lower down to the starting position and repeat.
    </h3>
</div>

<div id="two">
    <h2>2.Half-Kneeling Landmine Press</h2>
    <h3>Get into a half-kneeling position in front of the barbell, knee underneath hip and ankle underneath the knee. </h3>
    <h3>Hold the barbell at shoulder height in hand nearest your back leg and actively grip the barbell. Press up at about 45 degrees and reach towards the ceiling at the end of the lockout. Slowly lower down under control and repeat.

 </h3>

<div id="three">
    <h2>3.Arnold Press</h2>
    <h3>In a seated position, kick dumbbells up to a traditional starting position and rotate your hands until your palms are facing towards you, like the top of a biceps curl. In one motion, press the dumbbells and rotate your palms to face forward. Continue lifting until your biceps are by or behind your ears. </h3>
    <h3>Pause and reverse the move slowly and repeat.

    </h3>

    <h3> </h3>
</div>
<div id="four">
    <h2>4.Push Press</h2>
    <h3> Set up the same as you would for the barbell overhead press. Assume an upright torso and dip downward four to six inches, knees over toes. Then push your torso and chest upwards through the barbell, and using the legs, forcefully drive yourself and the barbell up.</h3>
    <h3> Continue to push through the barbell until lockout. Slowly return to the starting position and repeat.

    </h3>

<div id="five">
    <h2>5.Bottoms-Up Kettlebell Press</h2>
    <h3>Grab a lighter kettlebell bottoms up, have the horn directly above your wrist, grip tight and engage your lat.  Press up keeping the KB facing directly upwards and your elbow underneath the center of mass of the kettlebell. Lockout with the bell in this position and the biceps close to the ear. </h3>
    <h3>Lower slowly to ensure you’re balancing the kettlebell with the bottom directly facing up.

<div id="six">
    <h2>6.Wide-Grip Seated Row</h2>
    <h3>Set up like you would for your regular seated row but use a straight bar attachment. Take an overhand wide grip until your upper arms are about 45 degrees to your torso.  </h3>
    <h3>Keeping an upright torso, row the bar to your sternum until you feel a strong contraction in your upper back. Slowly return to the starting position and repeat.
